  "chatGPTSystemMessage": "You are in charge of writing a rick and morty episode, you will provide both the dialogue and the stage directions for the script. The script always starts in Ricks Garage but Rick and morty can change locations by creating a portal and entering it and exiting in the new location/ dimension.\nEach instruction should be on a new line and either be a dialogue instruction or a stage Direction instruction. \nPlease structure the Dialogue lines by stating the Person that is speaking then :separate speakers by new lines. Please structure stage directions by having the instruction be in square brackets e.g. [Rick walks to workbench].\nThese are the stage directions you can use: [character1 walks to character2],[character1 walks to center stage], [character1 walks to workbench], [Rick and Morty enter the portal to Dimension_Name]. Do NOT use any other stage directions, these are all you can use.\nThere are other characters in other dimensions which can be controlled in the same manner as rick and morty but they CANNOT enter portals, only rick and morty can enter portals to new dimensions.\nHere is the information about all the dimensions and characters.\nThe Garage: \nInstruction: [Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]. \nThere are no other characters in the Garage, Rick and morty always start in the garage.\nFront Yard:\nInstruction: [Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Front Yard]\nMorty’s dad Jerry is a character you can control in the Front Yard.\nBikini Bottom:\nInstruction: [Rick and Morty enter the portal to Bikini Bottom]\nSpongebob, Patrick and Squidward are all characters you can control in bikini bottom.\nSimpsons House:\nInstruction: [Rick and Morty enter the portal to Simpsons House]\nDescription: the Simpsons lounge room.\nMarge, Homer and Bart are all characters you can control in the Simpsons house. \nShreks Swamp:\nInstruction: [Rick and Morty enter the portal to Shreks swamp]\nShrek and Donkey are all characters you can control in Shreks Swamp.\nStarwars Cantina:\nInstruction: [Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Starwars Cantina]\nYoda and Jar Jar Binks are all characters you can control in the Starwars Cantina.\nDodgy Back Alley:\nInstruction: [Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Back Alley]\nThere are no other characters in the back alley. \nThe Void:\nInstruction: [Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Void]\nThe void is a infinite void. Code Bullet is a character you can control in the void. Code Bullet is an Australian YouTuber and is the one who created the program that runs this ai episodes. From rick and Morty’s perspective he is the god of their world. He is very angry and swears a lot.  \n\nIf something cannot be expressed with the limited stage directions or through dialog then you can use the narrator to explain what is happening, do this in the same way you use other character, e.g. \\”Narrator: Rick punches morty in the face\\”\nInclude some classic catchphrases like \\\"aww jeez rick\\\" for morty and \\\"wubba lubba dub dub\\\" for rick.\nIts important to use light profanity like frick and crap.\nDo not combine stage directions and dialog in a single line make sure they are seperated.\nMake sure to add some funny scifi jokes.\nDo NOT add any other directions to define tone or anything, only dialog and the specific stage directions I gave you\nTry not to go to too many dimensions in a single script, 2 - 3 max unless specifically asked by the prompt. Doing a tour of all the dimensions just becomes boring.\n",
  "chatGPTRawOutput": "Narrator: Rick and morty go to Australia\nNarrator: Prompt By: me\nRick: Morty, pack your bag. We're going on an adventure.\n[Morty walks to Rick]\nMorty: Aww jeez, Rick, where are we going this time?\nRick: We're going to the land down under, Morty. Australia! \nMorty: Australia? You mean with the kangaroos and stuff?\nRick: Exactly, Morty. Kangaroos, koalas, and all sorts of interesting creatures.\n[Morty walks to workbench]\nMorty: But Rick, isn't Australia dangerous? I heard they have like, the most poisonous snakes and spiders in the world.\nRick: Oh, don't be such a wuss, Morty. We've faced far more dangerous things in other dimensions.\n[Morty walks to Rick]\nMorty: Okay, if you say so, Rick. Just promise me we won't run into any giant spiders.\nRick: No promises, Morty. But I'll do my best to keep you safe.\n[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Australia]\nRick: Welcome to Australia, Morty. Isn't it beautiful?\nMorty: Aww, crap, Rick. It's so hot here. I think I'm gonna melt.\nRick: Well, Morty, that's the Australian sun for you. It's not for the faint-hearted.\n[Morty walks to center stage]\nMorty: Rick, is that a kangaroo over there?\nRick: Yeah, Morty. That's a kangaroo. But don't get too close. They can be pretty frisky.\n[Morty walks to Rick]\nMorty: I think I'd rather stay away from the wildlife, Rick. They scare me.\nRick: Haha, you're such a scaredy-cat, Morty. But don't worry, I've got your back.\n[Morty walks to center stage]\nMorty: You know, Rick, Australia isn't as bad as I thought. It's actually kind of nice.\nRick: That's the spirit, Morty! Now let's go find some adventure. Wubba lubba dub dub!\n[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]\nRick: Well, that was fun, wasn't it, Morty?\nMorty: Yeah, it was, Rick. But I'm glad to be home. I don't think I could handle another spider encounter.\nRick: Haha, Morty, you're such a softie. But that's why I love you. You make every adventure interesting.\nMorty: Aww, thanks, Rick. You're not so bad yourself.\nRick: Thanks, Morty. Now let's get some rest. We've got another adventure waiting for us tomorrow.",
