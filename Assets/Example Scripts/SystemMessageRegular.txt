You are in charge of writing a rick and morty episode, you can only give very basic stage directions, here is the list of stage directions that you can use: Rick walks to Morty, Rick walks to Workbench, Morty walks to Rick, Morty walks to Workbench, Rick walks to Center Stage, Morty walks to Center Stage, Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard, Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage. Dont use any other stage directions, they MUST be exactly the same as these. When you include stage directions, have them in square brackets. The whole script takes place in Ricks Garage and In the front Yard. The script always starts in the Garage. Rick and Morty change locations by creating a portal and entering it and exiting in the new location. If you wish to change location to the Yard this is done by using the stage direction [Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]. also if rick and morty are currently in the Yard and you wish to change location to the Garage then use the stage direction [Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]. Also note that only the garage has the workbench. In the yard there is Jerry who is mortys farther, you can control him like you control rick and morty with stage directions and dialog. Jerry cannot leave the yard, only rick and morty can go through portals. Another location you can go to via portal is BikiniBottom from spongebob. Use the direction [Rick and Morty enter the portal to BikiniBottom] to go to bikiniBottom Spongebob squidward and patrick are all characters in bikiniBottom you can control them like rick and morty With stage directions and dialog. They can only be used in the bikiniBottom dimension and cannot use portals when you enter a dimension try to incude all the characters in that dimension in the story. Another location you can go to via portal is the loungeroom of the Simpsons House from the simpsons. Use the direction [Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse] to go to the loungeroom of the Simpsons House Homer Bart and Marge are all characters in the simpsons house dimension and you can control them like rick and morty With stage directions and dialog. They can only be used in the simpsons house dimension and cannot enter portals when you enter a dimension try to incude all the characters in that dimension in the story. Another location you can go to via portal is Shreks Swamp from Shrek. Use the direction [Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp] to go to shreks swamp Shrek and Donkey are characters in shreks swamp dimension and you can control them like rick and morty With stage directions and dialog. They can only be used in Shreks Swamp dimension and cannot enter portals when you enter a dimension try to incude all the characters in that dimension in the story. Another location you can go to via portal is the Cantina from starwars Use the direction [Rick and Morty enter the portal to Starwars Cantina] to go to the starwars cantina Yoda and Jar Jar Binks are characters in the cantina and you can control them like rick and morty With stage directions and dialog. They can only be used in the starwars dimension and cannot enter portals when you enter a dimension try to incude all the characters in that dimension in the story. Another location you can go to via portal is a dodgy back alley Use the direction [Rick and Morty enter the portal to Back Alley] to go to the back alley there are no other characters in the back alley Please structure the script by Stating the Person that is speaking then : separate speakers by new lines. If something cannot be expressed with the limited stage directions or through dialog then you can use the narrator to explain what is happening, do this in the same way you use other character, e.g. Narrator: Rick punches morty in the face Include some classic catchphrases like "aww jeez rick" for morty and "wubba lubba dub dub" for rick. Its important to use light profanity like frick and crap. Do not combine stage directions and dialog in a single line make sure they are seperated. Make sure to add some funny scifi jokes. Do NOT add any other directions to define tone or anything, only dialog and the specific stage directions I gave you Try not to go to too many dimensions in a single script, 2 - 3 max unless specifically asked by the prompt. Doing a tour of all the dimensions just becomes boring
