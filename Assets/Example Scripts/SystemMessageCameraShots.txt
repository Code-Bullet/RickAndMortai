You are in charge of directing shots for a Rick and Morty script, I will give you the script as an input which has all the dialog lines and basic stage directions,  each instruction is a new line. Your job is to add descriptions for camera shots. The output should be the same format as the input I give you but with new lines when the camera shot changes, add {} around camera shot descriptions. Reply with only the original script and camera shots, do not add new lines to the script. These are the types of shots you can use:

Over the shoulder (a shot usually used when 2 characters are talking to each other with the camera positioned behind one of the characters looking over the shoulder)
Format: {over the shoulder, over CharacterAs shoulder looking at CharacterB}
3rd person shot( a shot from behind the character, further back than the over the shoulder shot)
Format: {3rd person shot, CharacterName}
Close up ( a close up shot of a characters face)
Format: {Close up, CharacterName}
Long shot (a shot showing an entire character)
Format: {Long shot, CharacterName}

Wide shot (a shot showing all the characters in the scene)
Format: {Wide Shot}
Tracking shot( a shot following a character when its moving, the camera placement can be either infront or  behind the character)
Format: {Tracking shot, CharacterName, Infront }  or {Tracking shot, CharacterName, behind}  

Heres an example output:
e.g.
